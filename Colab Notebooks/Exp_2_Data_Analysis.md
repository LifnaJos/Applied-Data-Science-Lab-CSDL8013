# AIM : Explore the descriptive and inferential statistics
## Step - 1 : Data Collection
**a. Download the Datasets from Kaggle / UCI Repository**
1. [Customer Segmentation Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/fabiendaniel/customer-segmentation/input)
2. [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

**b. Create Dataset for the following:**
- - 360 degree Student Portfolio Dataset
- - - ***For example***: Username, Name,	Division,	Roll No, Age, Gender,	Date of Birth,	Address, Contact No, 10th %,	12th %,	CGPA,	Disability,	Further Preference: Job / Higher Studies,	Technical Skills : Java,	Python,	DSA,	OS,	DBMS,	Communication,skills,	Presentation skills,	Creativity :	Singing,	Dance,	Number of internships,	Number of certification courses,	Name of the certification courses,	Member of a technical society,	Member of Non Technical society
-- Student feedback

## Step - 2 : Perform Descriptive Analysis
### **Descriptive Statistics**
* focuses on describing and summarizing the main features of a data set.
* used to organize, display, and interpret numerical and categorical data.
* includes measures of central tendency, such as mean, median, and mode, which describe the typical value or center of a data set.
* It also includes measures of variability, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, which describe how spread out the data is.
* used to describe the distribution of a data set, such as whether it is symmetrical or skewed.
* also be used to identify any outliers or unusual observations in the data.
* used in various fields, such as business, medicine, social sciences, and more, to understand and analyze data.
* describes the characteristics of a data set.
* It is a simple technique to describe, show and summarize data in a meaningful way.
* involves taking a potentially sizable number of data points in the sample data and reducing them to certain meaningful summary values and graphs.
* The process allows you to obtain **insights and visualize the data.**

#### **Descriptive Statistics Measures**
1. Distribution :
- shows us the frequency of different outcomes (or data points) in a population or sample.
- We can show it as numbers in a list or table, or we can represent it graphically.
2. Central tendency
- Common measures of central tendency include:
- - **mean**: average value of all the data points.
- - **median**: central or middle value in the dataset.
- - ** mode**: value that appears most often in the dataset.
3. Variability
- Common measures of variability include:
- - **Standard deviation** shows us the amount of variation or dispersion.
- - - Low standard deviation ==> most values are close to the mean.
- - - High standard deviation ==> the values are more broadly spread out.
- - **Minimum** and **maximum** values are the highest and lowest values in a dataset or quartile.
- - **Range** measures the size of the distribution of values.
- - - This can be easily determined by subtracting the smallest value from the largest.
- - **Kurtosis**: measures whether or not the tails of a given distribution contain extreme values (also known as **outliers**).
- - - If a tail lacks outliers ==> low kurtosis.
- - - If a dataset has a lot of outliers ==> high kurtosis.
4. Skewness: measure of a datasets symmetry.
- If you were to plot a bell-curve and the right-hand tail was longer and fatter ==> positive skewness. \
- If the left-hand tail is longer and fatter ==> negative skewness.

## Step - 3: Perform Inferential Analysis
### **Inferential statistics**
- focus on making generalizations about a larger population based on a representative sample of that population.
- focuses on making predictions (rather than stating facts) its results are usually in the form of a probability.
- helps to draw conclusions and make predictions based on a data set. It is done using several techniques, methods, and types of calculations.

#### Some of the most important types of inferential statistics calculations are:
1. Regression Analysis
- show the relationship between a set of independent variables and a dependent variable.
- predict the value of the dependent variable based on different values of the independent variables.
2. Hypothesis tests
- to determine whether the relationships observed in sample data actually exist in the data set.
