# Experiment - 3: Explore Data Visualization libraries in Python and R

## Lab Outcomes (LO):
- Demonstrate exploration and visualization techniques (LO3)

## Task to be performed :
1. Explore Top-5 Data Visualization Libraries in Python (w.r.t Features & Applications)
2. Explore Top-5 Data Visualization Libraries in R (w.r.t Features & Applications)
3. Install 2 Libraries each for Python and R
4. Perform the basic charts on the 2 identified libraries each for Python and R taking any dataset

## Tools & Libraries to be explored
* Python Libraries : Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotnine(ggplot), Bokeh, pygal, Plotly, geoplotlib, Gleam, missingno, Leather, Altair, Folium
* R Libararies : ggplot2, Lattice, highcharter, Leaflet, RColorBrewer, Plotly, sunburstR, RGL, dygraphs

## Theory to be written:
1. Write the features & applications of 5 Data Visualization Libraries in Python.
2. Write the features & applications of 5 Data Visualization Libraries in R.

## Outcome :
* Identified the Data Visualziation Libraries in Python and R
* Performed simple experiments with these libraries in Python and R
