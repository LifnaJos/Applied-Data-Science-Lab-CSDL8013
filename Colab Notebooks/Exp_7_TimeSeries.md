# Experiment - 7 : Time Series Analysis in Python

## Lab Outcomes (LO):
* Build various time series models on a given data set. (LO3)

## Task to be performed :
1. Refer the Google Colab Notebook for [Times Series Analysis using Python](https://github.com/LifnaJos/ADC601-Data-Analytics-Visualization/blob/main/M3_DAV.ipynb)
2. Select a Time Series Data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/?search=Time+series)
3. Experiment the data with the code from the Google Colab and derive meaningful conclusions from your dataset
4. Prepare a Colab Notebook with the Aim, Tasks performed, Program, Output, and Conclusion and upload the Notebook in your Github Repositiry.
5. Prepare a handwritten wrtieup with Aim, Theory and Conclusion.

## Tools & Libraries to be explored
* Python Libraries: statsmodels, matplotlib, numpy, pandas,math, sklearn,pmdarima

## Theory to be written:
1. Significance of Time Series 
2. Components of Time Series Data
3. Difference between Additive and Multiplicative Decomposition
4. Explain Exponential Smoothing
5. Difference between ACF and PACF
6. Explain the components of ARIMA Model
7. Explain the steps incolved in building and evaluating ARIMA Models
   
## Outcome :
* Understood the concept of Time Series Data
* Performed Time Series Analysis using the Libraries in Python
