## Lab Outcomes (LO's)
At the end of the course, students will be able to
1. Apply various stages of the data science lifecycle for the selected case study
2. Demonstrate data preparation for the selected case study
3. Demonstrate exploration and visualization techniques
4. Implement and evaluate different supervised and unsupervised techniques

## Lab Experiments
| No | Name of Experiment | LO's |
| :--: | ------------------ | :----: |
| 1. | Explore the descriptive and inferential statistics on the given dataset. | LO1,LO2 |
| 2. | Apply data cleaning techniques (e.g. Data Imputation) | LO1, LO2 |
| 3. | Explore data visualization techniques. | LO3 |
| 4. | Implement  and  explore performance evaluation metrics for Data Models (Supervised/Unsupervised Learning)  | LO2, LO3 |
| 5. | Use SMOTE technique to generate synthetic data.(to solve the problem of class imbalance) | LO3 |
| 6. | Outlier detection using distance-based/density-based method  | LO2, LO3 |
| 7. | Implement time series forecasting. | LO4 |
| 8. | Illustrate the data science lifecycle for the selected case study. (Prepare case study document for the selected case study  | LO4 |
