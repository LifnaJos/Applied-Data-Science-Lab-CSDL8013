## Lab Outcomes (LO's)
At the end of the course, students will be able to
1. Apply various stages of the data science lifecycle for the selected case study
2. Demonstrate data preparation for the selected case study
3. Demonstrate exploration and visualization techniques
4. Implement and evaluate different supervised and unsupervised techniques

## Lab Experiments
